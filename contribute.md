### **How to format [#incompatibilities](./incompatibilities.md):**
Please sort the table by Minecraft version from latest to oldest.
- Example: 1.17 or new should be above 1.16 and lower.

If the versions tab doesn't show the OptiFine Version, only the Minecraft version, this means it is an issue on all OptiFine Versions (or atleast most of them.)

```
| Mod | Bug Report | Version(s) | Fix | Tested |
